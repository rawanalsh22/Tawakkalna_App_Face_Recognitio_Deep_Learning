# Tawakkalna App Face Recognition

### Objective:
Tawakkalna App was developed by the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) to assist the government in combating Covid-19.
In total, Tawakkalna App offers 44 services to Saudi government ministries such as the Ministry of Health, Hajj, and Umra.
Through the use of Facial Recognition, this project intends to ensure the real identity of Tawakkalna users by checking if the picture matches the person's national ID.

This is a security feature that can be used to recognize people's real identities in crowded areas such as Hajj and Umrah , where it is otherwise difficult to identify them.


### Data Description:

This dataset contains **10 images** of **40** distinct people with **400 images** of their faces.
