# The Final Report to Deep Learning - Tawakkalna App Face Recognition 


## 1. Abstract

> Tawakkalna App was developed by the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) to assist the government in combating Covid-19. In total, Tawakkalna App offers 44 services to Saudi government ministries such as the Ministry of Health, Hajj, and Umra. 
Through the use of Facial Recognition, this project intends to ensure the real identity of Tawakkalna users by checking if the picture matches the person's national ID. This is a security feature that can be used to recognize people's real identities in crowded areas such as Hajj and Umrah , where it is otherwise difficult to identify them.



## 2.Design

> ensure the real identity of Tawakkalna users by checking if the picture matches the person's national ID or not?
> 
## 3.Data

> This dataset contains 10 images of 40 distinct people with 400 images of their faces. Each image has the same background and size. These images will be our main method of reference throughout this project. From them, subsets will be created for Testing and Training.

## 4.Algorithm
> This study aims to perform facial recognition using four different classification models to determine which one is the best to use.
#### The data splitted into:
- **Training** : 80 % 
- **testing** : 20 % 
 

## 5.Result
### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is the best model with 10 layers
